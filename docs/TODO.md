# TODO

### top ideas
- *** support "happy range" for percents, e.g. 0-85 == happy
- support single data point bar graph. e.g. INFO: XXX, INFO: XXXXXX, INFO: XXX, etc.

## UI
- support even more sparkline graphs
- support configuration of graphs

## Metrics
- Other metrics?


## Typing
- Handing of numbers is ugly.
