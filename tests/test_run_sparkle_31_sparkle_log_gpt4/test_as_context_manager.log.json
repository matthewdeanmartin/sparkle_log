Don't \nforget to write test functions! Use mocks or fakes as needed, but don't reimplement the code under test- that already \nexists.\n\n## Tooling\nUse pytest style testing. Use unittest.mock for mocking. pytest, unittest.mock\n\nDo not, under any circumstances, use unittest.TestCase.\n\n\n## Coding preferences\n- The target python version is 3.10\n- Make sure code is cross-platform and does not use linux-only modules. \n- Prefer pathlib.Path whenever possible. \n- When using the open() command, always specify the encoding, which should be utf-8 unless something else makes better sense.\n\n## common patterns/antipatterns\n- Do not write pytest tests in the form of a sample invocation (i.e. not wrapped in a function), but do write in the \n  body of a `def test_...` function\n- Do make use of the tmp_path fixture for writing files. Do not unnecessarily mock `open` to avoid writing files, \n  just write an example file to tmp_path.\n\n```\nfrom tests.env_util import temporary_env_var\n\nwith temporary_env_var(\"NAME\",

This test should check multiple inputs \nand their expected outputs for a single function. Utilize unittest.mock to simulate any external interactions and Path for handling file paths. This will help us ensure our function behaves correctly under various conditions.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Given the code and instructions provided, I'll write a parameterized unit test for the `MetricMonitor` class `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods in the `sparkle_log.as_context_manager.py` module. Since the main external interaction to mock in these methods is the `GLOBAL_LOGGER` object (to check if it is enabled for logging at the `INFO` level) and the interactions with the thread that runs `run_scheduler`, mocking will be employed for these aspects. Using `pytest` along with `unittest.mock.patch`, we can effectively simulate different environments and conditions. There is no direct interaction with file paths within the given code, so `pathlib.Path` won't be used in these particular tests. Instead, we focus on the logging and threading aspects.\n\n### Writing the Parametrized PyTest\n\nFirst, we need to import necessary libraries and functions:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, Mock\nfrom threading import Event\nfrom sparkle_log.as_context_manager import MetricMonitor\n```\n\nThen, we structure our parameterized test for both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods:\n\n```python\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"log_enabled, expected_thread_start\", [\n    (True, True),  # Test Case: Logger enabled, expect thread to start\n    (False, False),  # Test Case: Logger not enabled, expect thread not to start\n])\ndef test_MetricMonitor_context_management(log_enabled, expected_thread_start):\n    with patch(\"sparkle_log.as_context_manager.GLOBAL_LOGGER.isEnabledFor\") as mock_isEnabledFor:\n        # Mock GLOBAL_LOGGER to control isEnabledFor behavior\n        mock_isEnabledFor.return_value = log_enabled\n\n        # Mock run_scheduler to observe if it's called\n        with patch(\"sparkle_log.as_context_manager.Thread\") as mock_thread:\n            mock_thread_instance = Mock()\n            mock_thread.return_value = mock_thread_instance\n\n            # Using MetricMonitor as context manager to trigger __enter__\n            with MetricMonitor(metrics=(\"cpu\",), interval=5) as monitor:\n                pass\n\n            # Check that the thread's start method is called if log is enabled\n            if expected_thread_start:\n                mock_thread_instance.start.assert_called_once()\n            else:\n                mock_thread_instance.start.assert_not_called()\n\n    # After the context block exits, __exit__ is called, testing it's behaviour\n    mock_thread_instance.join.assert_called_with()\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Parameterization**: The test runs twice with different values for `log_enabled` and `expected_thread_start`, allowing us to check the behavior when the `GLOBAL_LOGGER` is enabled and when it is not.\n2. **Mocks and Patches**: We mock `GLOBAL_LOGGER.isEnabledFor` to return our parameterized `log_enabled` value to simulate the logger being enabled or disabled. Then, we mock `Thread` to verify whether the `start` method is called based on the logger's state.\n3. **Context Manager Test**: We use the `MetricMonitor` in a `with` block to test the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. The implementation details, such as threading and logging, are mocked out, focusing the test on the `MetricMonitor`'s behavior in response to our mock configurations.\n\nThis test adequately simulates the conditions and interactions within the `MetricMonitor`'s context manager functionality, verifying that threads are appropriately started and joined based on the logging configuration without the need for actual system logging or thread execution."},{"role":"user","content":"\nSource Path: E:\\github\\sparkle_log\\sparkle_log\\as_context_manager.py\n\nSource Path: E:\\github\\sparkle_log\\sparkle_log\\as_context_manager.py\nModule Name: sparkle_log.as_context_manager\n```python\nimport logging\nimport time\nfrom threading import Event, Thread\nfrom typing import Any, Optional\n\nfrom sparkle_log.global_logger import GLOBAL_LOGGER\nfrom sparkle_log.scheduler import run_scheduler\n\n\nclass MetricMonitor:\n    def __init__(self, metrics=(\"cpu\", \"memory\"), interval: int = 10) -> None:\n        self.metrics = metrics\n        self.interval = interval\n        self.stop_event: Optional[Event] = None\n        self.scheduler_thread: Optional[Thread] = None\n\n    def __enter__(self) -> \"MetricMonitor\":\n        if GLOBAL_LOGGER.isEnabledFor(logging.INFO):\n            self.stop_event = Event()\n            self.scheduler_thread = Thread(target=run_scheduler, args=(self.stop_event, self.metrics, self.interval))\n            self.scheduler_thread.start()\n        return self\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type: Any, exc_value: Any, traceback: Any) -> None:\n        if self.scheduler_thread and self.scheduler_thread.is_alive():\n            self.stop_event.set()\n            self.scheduler_thread.join()\n\n\n# Usage example with the context manager\n```\n\nHere are function and method signatures of the dependencies\n\n```python\n#sparkle_log/scheduler.py\ndef run_scheduler(stop_event: Event, metrics: tuple[str, ...], seconds: int):\n    \"\"\"Run scheduled tasks until the stop_event is set.\"\"\"\n    ...\n\n```\n\n\nNext, let's focus on testing simulated exceptions.

This is a basic resource management pattern that doesn't involve complex error handling logic.\n\nHowever, for the sake of addressing the request and showcasing how one might test for sensible behavior in the face of exceptions (even if the original code does not explicitly manage exceptions), let's consider a hypothetical scenario where an exception is raised within the `with` block where the `MetricMonitor` is used. We'll ensure that the `__exit__` method behaves as expected, i.e., it still attempts to clean up by joining the thread.\n\nSince the given requirement doesn't align perfectly with the code provided (i.e., there's no direct interaction with file paths and not much in the way of exceptions to handle), the outlined test will focus on a constructed example to demonstrate the testing of exception handling.\n\n### Writing the Unit Test with Pytest and unittest.mock\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock\nfrom threading import Event\nfrom sparkle_log.as_context_manager import MetricMonitor\n\nclass TestException(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception for testing purposes.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\ndef test_MetricMonitor_exception_handling():\n    with patch(\"sparkle_log.as_context_manager.GLOBAL_LOGGER.isEnabledFor\", return_value=True), \\\n         patch(\"sparkle_log.as_context_manager.Thread\") as mock_thread:\n        mock_thread_instance = MagicMock()\n        mock_thread.return_value = mock_thread_instance\n        \n        # Simulate an exception within the with block\n        try:\n            with MetricMonitor(metrics=(\"cpu\",), interval=5) as monitor:\n                raise TestException(\"Testing exception handling.\")\n        except TestException:\n            pass # Exception is expected, continue to check if cleanup occurs\n        \n        # Verify that despite the exception, the cleanup process (thread join) is still attempted\n        mock_thread_instance.join.assert_called_once()\n```\n\nIn this test:\n- **Custom Exception Handling**: We define a custom `TestException` to raise within the `with` block to simulate an error occurring during the lifetime of the context manager.\n- **Mocks and Assertions**: `GLOBAL_LOGGER.isEnabledFor` is mocked to ensure the logger is considered enabled (triggering the thread start), and `Thread` is mocked to verify behavior without executing real threading logic.\n- **Exception Handling Verification**: After simulating an exception within the `with` block, the focus is on whether the `__exit__` method correctly attempts to clean up by joining the thread, despite the occurrence of the exception.

For `MetricMonitor`, this involves creating an instance, using it within a context manager, and ensuring it starts and stops the scheduler thread as expected.\n\n## Edge Cases\n\nEdge cases could involve what happens when:\n- `GLOBAL_LOGGER.isEnabledFor(logging.INFO)` returns `False`, meaning logging is not enabled at the INFO level, and hence the scheduler should not start.\n- The monitor is used outside of a context manager, or misuse of the API.\n\n## Error Conditions\n\nError conditions simulate what happens when unexpected exceptions occur within the provided code block. However, the primary source of error handling would be ensuring that the thread is joined even if an exception is raised within the `with` block of the context manager, which was covered in a previous answer.
