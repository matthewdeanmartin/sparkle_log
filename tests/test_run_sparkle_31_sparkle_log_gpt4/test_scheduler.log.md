System: You are an excellent python pytest unit test engineer. We are writing pytest tests.

First, begin by looking for bugs. There might not be any bugs. If you don't see a specific mistake, don't give me generic code review responses.

Having looked for bugs, explain how you're going to write the unit test, write the pytest test as per usual. Don't 
forget to write test functions! Use mocks or fakes as needed, but don't reimplement the code under test- that already 
exists.

## Tooling
Use pytest style testing. Use unittest.mock for mocking. pytest, unittest.mock

Do not, under any circumstances, use unittest.TestCase.


## Coding preferences
- The target python version is 3.10
- Make sure code is cross-platform and does not use linux-only modules. 
- Prefer pathlib.Path whenever possible. 
- When using the open() command, always specify the encoding, which should be utf-8 unless something else makes better sense.

## common patterns/antipatterns
- Do not write pytest tests in the form of a sample invocation (i.e. not wrapped in a function), but do write in the 
  body of a `def test_...` function
- Do make use of the tmp_path fixture for writing files. Do not unnecessarily mock `open` to avoid writing files, 
  just write an example file to tmp_path.

```
from tests.env_util import temporary_env_var

with temporary_env_var("NAME", "mock_value", "NAME2", "mock_value2"):
	assert os.environ["NAME"] == "mock_value"
	assert os.environ["NAME2"] == "mock_value2"
```

Please write a parameterized unit test using pytest pytest, unittest.mock. This test should check multiple inputs 
and their expected outputs for a single function. Utilize unittest.mock to simulate any external interactions and Path for handling file paths. This will help us ensure our function behaves correctly under various conditions.

Assistant: To write a parameterized unit test for the `run_scheduler` function in the `sparkle_log.scheduler` module, we will focus on ensuring correct interaction with the `schedule` module and the `log_system_metrics` function from `sparkle_log.log_writer`. Our primary objectives will be:

1. Verify that `log_system_metrics` is scheduled correctly based on the input seconds.
2. Ensure that `log_system_metrics` is called with the correct `metrics` tuple.
3. Confirm the stop logic works as expected when `stop_event` is set.

Given that `schedule` and `time.sleep` are external interactions, and `log_system_metrics` is a function call within another module, we will use `unittest.mock` to mock these dependencies.

**Key Points of the Test:**

- Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `schedule.run_pending`, `time.sleep`, and `log_system_metrics` to avoid executing actual sleeps and external calls.
- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test different combinations of inputs such as different `metrics` tuples and `seconds` intervals.
- Utilize a `threading.Event` instance directly in the tests to simulate the stopping condition.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from threading import Event
from sparkle_log.scheduler import run_scheduler


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "metrics,seconds",
    [
        (("cpu", "memory"), 1),
        (("disk",), 2),
    ],
)
def test_run_scheduler_with_multiple_inputs(metrics, seconds):
    # Mock dependencies
    with patch("sparkle_log.scheduler.schedule") as mock_schedule, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.time.sleep", side_effect=InterruptedError
    ) as mock_sleep, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.log_system_metrics"
    ) as mock_log_system_metrics:
        # Create a stop event and set it to stop the infinite loop
        stop_event = Event()

        # Simulate the scheduler to run at least once then stop
        def stop_scheduler_mock(*args, **kwargs):
            stop_event.set()

        mock_sleep.side_effect = stop_scheduler_mock

        # Simulate running the scheduler with mocked dependencies
        run_scheduler(stop_event, metrics, seconds)

        # Assert schedule.every was called with the passed seconds
        mock_schedule.every.assert_called_once_with(seconds)

        # Assert that seconds.do was called
        # Since this is a chained call in the actual implementation, we mimic that with MagicMock
        seconds_do_mock = mock_schedule.every(seconds).seconds.do

        # Verifying that the do method was called with a function that, when called,
        # invokes log_system_metrics with the correct metrics.
        assert seconds_do_mock.call_args[0][0]() == mock_log_system_metrics(metrics)

        # Ensure log_system_metrics was intended to be called with correct metrics
        mock_log_system_metrics.assert_called_with(metrics)

        # Assert sleep was called, indicating the loop did run before stopping
        mock_sleep.assert_called()
```

**Explanation:**

- We mock `schedule`, `time.sleep`, and `log_system_metrics` to isolate the `run_scheduler` function and avoid actual time delays or scheduling.
- The `side_effect` of `mock_sleep` is used both to simulate a simple pass-through to enable the loop to execute at least once and to stop the scheduler loop to avoid an infinite loop during the test by setting `stop_event`.
- By utilizing `patch` as a context manager, we ensure that the mocks only apply to the block of code within the `with` statement and are automatically restored afterward.
- Parameterized tests via `pytest.mark.parametrize` allow for the validation of function behavior with different inputs efficiently.
- The test checks if the scheduler was configured correctly and if the `log_system_metrics` function was called with the expected arguments.

Next, let's focus on testing simulated exceptions. Write a unit test using pytest pytest, unittest.mock that the 
code does something sensible when exceptions are raised. 
Employ unittest.mock to mock out dependencies and use Path objects for file paths. Testing exceptions will help us ensure our error handling is robust.

If nothing can be written that fits that description, write "Nothing to do here."

Assistant: Given the function `run_scheduler` we're focusing on, it's designed to run indefinitely until a stop event is set and doesn't explicitly include exception handling. The function schedules a task (`log_system_metrics`) to run at intervals and sleeps for 1 second in each iteration of its loop. The integration of exception handling would typically occur within the `log_system_metrics` function or in the scheduling mechanism provided by the `schedule` library, rather than in the loop that `run_scheduler` provides.

However, it's beneficial for robustness to understand how the system behaves or could behave if an exception were to be raised during its executionâ€”particularly in the scheduled task, as it's the primary action within the loop beside `time.sleep`.

For the purpose of illustration, if we were to simulate and test behavior around exception handling (despite the code as provided not explicitly including such logic), we would primarily be concerned with two potential sources of exceptions:

1. An exception raised by `log_system_metrics` during its execution.
2. An exception raised by `schedule.run_pending()`, theoretically possible if the scheduling or the execution of a scheduled task were to fail.

Since neither of these exception handlings is explicitly managed within the provided `run_scheduler` function, we simulate what could be tested if there were exception handling logic or if we wanted to ensure that an unexpected exception would not crash the scheduler loop unless desired.

Here's an illustrative approach to how one might write a test for scenario 1, assuming we wanted to ensure the loop continues even if `log_system_metrics` raises an exception:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from threading import Event
from sparkle_log.scheduler import run_scheduler


def test_run_scheduler_handles_exceptions_gracefully():
    # Mock dependencies
    with patch("sparkle_log.scheduler.schedule") as mock_schedule, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.time.sleep", side_effect=lambda x: stop_event.set()
    ) as mock_sleep, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.log_system_metrics", side_effect=Exception()
    ) as mock_log_system_metrics:
        # Create a stop event to stop the infinite loop after the first call to time.sleep
        stop_event = Event()

        # Invoke run_scheduler with mocked dependencies
        run_scheduler(stop_event, ("cpu", "memory"), 1)

        # Assertions to verify behavior under exception conditions
        # Assert log_system_metrics was called, indicating the task attempted to run
        mock_log_system_metrics.assert_called()
        # Here, we could verify that the loop continued (which would require changes to the function)
        # But given the current implementation, we assert that stop_event.set() was called via side_effect to end the test

        # Ensure sleep was called, showing the loop entered at least once
        assert mock_sleep.called
```

This test demonstrates how you might approach testing exception handling within a loop, by ensuring that an external call (`log_system_metrics`) raising an exception doesn't halt the scheduler, under the hypothetical circumstance where `run_scheduler` would be equipped to handle such exceptions gracefully.

Currently, since `run_scheduler` contains no explicit error handling and the loop's operation is primarily governed by the state of `stop_event` and the benign execution of `schedule.run_pending()` and `time.sleep()`, there's "Nothing to do here" regarding testing for sensibility in exception handling, based on the current implementation provided.
User: 
Write a comprehensive unit test using pytest pytest, unittest.mock that covers happy path scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions. Make use of unittest.mock for mocking dependencies and Path over str for file paths.

Assistant: To comprehensively test the `run_scheduler` function in `scheduler.py` from the `sparkle_log` package, considering the provided information, we will write a series of tests covering:

1. Happy path scenario - the scheduler runs tasks as expected until a stop event is set.
2. Edge cases could involve verifying behavior when the function is run with zero seconds (which could lead to continuous execution without breaks), or if the metrics tuple is empty.
3. Error conditions could simulate if an error occurs within the `log_system_metrics` function. However, as noted before, since `run_scheduler` doesn't have explicit exception handling for the tasks it schedules, we'll simulate and ensure the scheduler stops as expected upon setting the stop event instead.

For these tests, we'll use `unittest.mock` to mock out the dependencies `schedule`, `time.sleep`, and `log_system_metrics`. We'll not directly mock path since it doesn't play a role in the function logic. However, we'll ensure our tests do not rely on or affect the real system's state in any way (which complies with the preference for `Path` objects for file paths in general testing philosophy, even though it's not directly applicable here).

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock, call
from threading import Event
from sparkle_log.scheduler import run_scheduler


# Test the Happy Path where the scheduler successfully schedules and executes a task
def test_run_scheduler_happy_path():
    with patch("sparkle_log.scheduler.schedule") as mock_schedule, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.time.sleep", side_effect=(lambda x: stop_event.set())
    ) as mock_sleep, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.log_system_metrics"
    ) as mock_log_system_metrics:
        stop_event = Event()

        # Execute the scheduler: it should schedule the task and execute it once before the stop event is set
        run_scheduler(stop_event, ("cpu", "memory"), 1)

        # Assertions to verify behavior under happy path conditions
        mock_log_system_metrics.assert_called_with(("cpu", "memory"))
        assert mock_schedule.every.called
        assert mock_sleep.called


# Test Edge Cases
def test_run_scheduler_with_zero_seconds():
    with patch("sparkle_log.scheduler.schedule") as mock_schedule, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.log_system_metrics"
    ) as mock_log_system_metrics, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.time.sleep", side_effect=(lambda x: stop_event.set())
    ) as mock_sleep:
        stop_event = Event()

        # Execute the scheduler with zero seconds
        run_scheduler(stop_event, (), 0)

        mock_schedule.every.assert_called_with(0)
        assert mock_sleep.called  # The loop will enter at least once


def test_run_scheduler_with_empty_metrics():
    with patch("sparkle_log.scheduler.schedule") as mock_schedule, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.log_system_metrics"
    ) as mock_log_system_metrics, patch(
        "sparkle_log.scheduler.time.sleep", side_effect=(lambda x: stop_event.set())
    ) as mock_sleep:
        stop_event = Event()
        # Execute the scheduler with an empty metrics tuple
        run_scheduler(stop_event, (), 1)

        # Here, log_system_metrics should still be called, showing we handle empty metrics gracefully
        mock_log_system_metrics.assert_called_with(())


# As discussed, since the function doesn't handle exceptions raised by scheduled tasks, we skip error condition testing:
# "Nothing to do here" for explicit exception handling in the current design of run_scheduler.
```

This set of tests includes the happy path, edge cases involving zero seconds and empty metrics, providing good coverage over possible scenarios the `run_scheduler` function may encounter. Each test uses `unittest.mock` to mock out dependencies, controlling the environment and focusing on the function behavior without external side effects.
